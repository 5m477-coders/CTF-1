Well, I'm not a music guru at all and for some reasons I thought the relation between the two pictures is their music genre or something like that but NO.  
I tried to bruteforce it.. I got 900+ strings to try ha ha ha.  
I challenged a friend to get it (as if I got the flag already lol :D).  
It took both of us a lot of time.. Let's see what we got.

There's a very rare relation between two of them which is a **Hash Collision**.

They also have the same **Timestamp**.
