> Do you remember something known as QR Code?

I used this [site](https://webqr.com/) to scan the QR code.  
I got a base64 string.. I used this [site](https://www.base64decode.org/) to decode it.  
I got a weird string.. I thought it's a caesar cipher so I used this [site](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) to decrypt it.
