> You need to work pretty hard for this one.

All you need to get the flag is to know what the cipher is.

1- Base64.. [Decode it](https://www.base64decode.org/).  
2- Hexadecimal.. [Decode it](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/).  
3- Binary.. [Decode it](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary).  
4- Base64.. [Decode it](https://www.base64decode.org/).

I have no idea why they call it hard or where I worked *pretty hard* to solve it.
